## about

### what it does

evolve generates a clean, interactive timeline for any topic you throw at it. you type something in, and our backend, powered by sonnet 4.5, builds a chronological story with key events. by default, it uses a single-pass generation for speed, but users can enable our multi-stage verification pipeline if they want more thoroughly vetted sources. the best part? the links actually work. we made sure of it. also the ui is nice.
